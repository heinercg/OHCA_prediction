# Neural Network Models for OHCA Prediction

This folder contains the neural network-based models developed for predicting **Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA)** using ECG signals. The models apply advanced deep learning architectures and signal processing techniques to classify ECG data obtained prior to cardiac arrest events.

This work corresponds to **Chapter 3** of the dissertation and explores time-series specialized machine learning algorithms, dimensionality reduction strategies, and explainability techniques.

## üìä Dataset

The **Subtyping Cardiac Arrest Dataset** was used, which includes ECG recordings from emergency department visits. ECGs recorded up to 24 hours before OHCA events were included, along with control ECGs up to 7 days before a non-OHCA event. Final counts:
- 23 OHCA ECGs (after filtering)
- 247 control ECGs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Signal Denoising and Augmentation**
   - Gaussian noise
   - Baseline shifts
   - Sine pulses
   - Time shifts

2. **Signal Segmentation**
   - One-second segments centered at R-peaks
   - 500 samples per segment

3. **Signal Scaling**
   - Z-score standardization applied per ECG signal

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - **Resampling** at 50, 100, and 200 Hz
   - **Wavelet Decomposition** using Daubechies (db2-db6), levels 3-5

## üß† Neural Network Models

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN Family)
- **Simple RNN**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**

### Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN)
- Used for both resampled and wavelet-transformed data

Each model was tested using:
- **Lead II only**
- **All 12 ECG leads**

## üîé Experiments

### Dimensionality Reduction Comparison
- Resampling: Optimal sampling rate = **100 Hz**
- Wavelet: Best performance with **db2 level 4**

### Model Performance (Sample)
| Model          | Leads     | Input Type       | Accuracy | F1 Score | AUROC |
|----------------|-----------|------------------|----------|----------|--------|
| LSTM           | 12 leads  | Wavelet db2-l4    | 0.988    | 0.988    | 0.988  |
| Simple RNN     | 12 leads  | Resampled (100Hz) | 0.964    | 0.964    | 0.964  |
| RBFN           | Lead II   | Resampled (100Hz) | 0.963    | 0.963    | 0.963  |

## üìà Imbalanced Dataset Tests

Performance was evaluated across five imbalance ratios: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:5, 1:10. Key finding: **F1-score** decreased with imbalance, while **accuracy and AUROC** remained misleadingly stable.

## üß† Explainability: TimeSHAP

To interpret model predictions:
- **Feature-level analysis:** Identified important leads (V2, V4, III)
- **Event-level analysis:** Found that the last 30 time steps before prediction were most influential
- **Global SHAP values:** Revealed contributions across leads and time

---

## üèÜ Best Model

**LSTM + resampling (100 Hz) + 12 leads**
- Accuracy: 0.988
- F1 Score: 0.988
- Excellent generalization on the test set
- Minimal overfitting
